		"A quote from Professor Cutler: \n\"Quack quack duck quack quack quack quack rubber duck quack quack. Quack quack duck quack quackity quack  quack  duck  quack  quack.   Quack  quack  duck  quack  quack  quack  quack  rubber  duck  quack  quack. Quack quack duck quack quackity quack quack duck quack quack.\"",
		"The quintessential duckâ€™s quack is the sound of the female mallard. Females often give this call in a series of 2â€“10 quacks that begin loudly and get softer. When courting, she may give a paired form of this quack. The male does not quack; instead he gives a quieter, rasping, one- or two-noted call. Ducklings make soft, shrill whistles when alarmed.",
		"Males make a rattling noise by rubbing the bill against the flight feathers in a special display that resembles stylized preening. This display is given toward a mate and presumably helps maintain the pair bond.", 
		"Any given duck may have different sounds for courtship songs, fending off an intruder, showing stress or begging for food. The pitch, rhythm, volume, raspiness, breathiness, number of repetitions, and other qualities of the sound can also vary depending on the situation, species, age, and gender of the bird. For example, nestlings generally have quieter, breathier, more urgent vocalizations as they beg for food. On the other hand, an adult duck's alarm call is generally more strident and louder to alert other ducks to a potential threat.",
		"Listening carefully to positively identified ducks, such as the familiar ducks at a local pond. This will help birders learn to better identify those common species and note when other sounds are audible that would indicate unusual visitors.",
		"While it can be tempting to use duck calls as the only identification clue, it can be very challenging to tell different ducks apart by voice alone, and even experienced birders may be fooled by a unique duck sound. As with any bird identification, it is best to use a variety of clues to positively identify the bird, including not only sounds, but also plumage, size, behavior, range, and other characteristics.",
		"One of the hardest things to note about duck sounds is that ducks aren't the only birds that quack. Because ducks have such an array of different sounds in their vocabulary, their voices can sound similar to many other types of birds, including the other members of the Anatidae family, geese, and swans. Cranes, herons, pelicans, cormorants and even some raptors can make similar sounds and could be confused for ducks. In areas with large, vocal duck populations, skilled bird mimics may even incorporate duck-like sounds into their repertoire.",
		"Female domestic ducks (except muscovies) make a loud alarm call \"QUACK!\" when they are startled, hungry, or separated from a member of their group. Drakes (males) can't make this sound at all.  All females have the ability to make this sound, but their inclination to do it seems highly individual.", 
		"Males make a rattling noise by rubbing the bill against the flight feathers in a special display that resembles stylized preening. This display is given toward a mate and presumably helps maintain the pair bond.",
		"The ubiquitous quack is always associated with ducks, but ducks actually make many other vocal and non-vocal sounds. Recognizing the sounds ducks make is essential for birding by ear whenever these wonderful waterfowl are involved.",
		"The familiar \"quack\" attributed to all ducks is usually the female mallard's quacking, though many female dabbling ducks make similar quacking noises. Quacks are not the only sounds in ducks' vocabularies, though. While ducks generally do not sing, they can make a variety of vocalizations.",
